# SQL-challenge _(Module 9 Challenge)_

This repository contains a quick project in which I was tasked to do research about a group of previous employees of a fictional company called _Pewlett Hackard_ as a data engineer. I was given a small database of six CSV files about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.

First, I modelled the data to create a suitable Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files. Next, I engineered a SQL database to which I imported the files. Finally, I analysed the data by coding eight queries to get detailed information about the employees, their salary, and their departments. 

You will find all the files in the _EmployeeSQL_ folder, which contains:

## A _data_ folder:

It has the initial six CSV files.

## A _Physical_ERD_ image:

It depicts a detailed relationship between all the entities created, their data types, primary keys, and foreign keys. It was modelled with the Quick Database Diagrams ([QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)) app.

## A _csv-files-analysis_ Jupyter Notebook:

It was used to explore the data of the CSV files before modelling the tables, engineering the database, and coding the queries.

## A _queries_ SQL file:

It contains the eight queries coded to get specific information about the previous employees.

## A _schema_ SQL file:

It has the table schema that was coded to create the SQL database. The database creation went through three stages, which are explained in the file.
